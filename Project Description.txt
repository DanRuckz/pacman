Pacman project:

1) This project is a proof of concept of the pacman game, it's a replica of the all too known
pacman game.

2) This project is for entertainment purposes, and for my own self development/fun.

3) It is not estimated to be a huge project, just a simple small game well made.

4) The Objects in the game: A basic starting menu (a few buttons with options) The map 
(including the bounds and so), the player, the enemies
and the collectibles.

5) The ways to interact with the project is first of all a menu that will open up asking the 
player to define/change various settings such as sound, see the credits and perhaps a resolution
change will be added and of course to start the game. After the game has started then the
player will take the roll of pacman and will have to collect the collectibles while avoiding
all kinds of ghosty enemies. as it is just a proof of concept, the pacman will win once 
the collectibles are collected and will lost upon collision with the ghosts (3 lives).
